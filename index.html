                <p>My brother is four years old. He is two years younger than I. I like him very much because he is lovable and cute. We often play with each other. Sometimes he will cry when I accidentally hurt him while we are playing. I will say sorry to him and he will stop crying.He and I like sweets and chocolates. We often share our sweets and chocolates. Mother often tells us not to eat too much of sweet things because it is bad for our teeth. She is correct because every time we visit the dentist, he will tell us that he will need to fill up our decayed teeth.</p>
